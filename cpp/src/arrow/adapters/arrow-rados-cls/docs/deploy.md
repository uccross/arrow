# Installing SkyhookDM

1. If you don't already have a Ceph cluster, please follow [this](https://blog.risingstack.com/ceph-storage-deployment-vm/) guide to create one. You may also run [this](../scripts/deploy_ceph.sh) script for a 3 OSD Ceph cluster and a CephFS mount.

2. Build and install SkyhookDM and [PyArrow](https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow/) (with Rados Parquet extensions) using [this](../scripts/deploy_skyhook.sh) script.

3. Update your Ceph configuration file with this line and restart the OSDs to reload the changes.
```
osd class load list = *
```

# Interacting with SkyhookDM

1. Write some [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) files in the CephFS mount. We need to use the [`deploy_data.sh`](../scripts/deploy_data.sh) script to write Parquet files to CephFS for use in SkyhookDM. For example,
```bash
./deploy_data.sh myfile.parquet /mnt/cephfs/myfile.parquet 100 67108864
```
Running this command would write 100 Parquet files in the format `myfile.parquet.N` in the `/mnt/cephfs` directory with an object size of 64MB.

**NOTE**: If you have Parquet files of size > 128MB, please use the [`SplittedParquetWriter`](../../../../../../python/pyarrow/rados.py) to split your Parquet file into 128 MB or less sized files.

2. Write a client script and get started with querying datasets in SkyhookDM. An example script is given below.
```python
import pyarrow.dataset as ds

format_ = ds.RadosParquetFileFormat("/path/to/cephconfig", "cephfs-data-pool-name")
dataset_ = ds.dataset("file:///mnt/cephfs/dataset", format=format_)
print(dataset_.to_table())
```
