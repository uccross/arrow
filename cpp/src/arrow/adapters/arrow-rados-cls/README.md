# SkyhookDM-Arrow

Apache Arrow provides a `Dataset` API, which acts as an abstraction over a collection of files in different storage backend like S3 and HDFS. It supports different file formats like CSV and Parquet through the `FileFormat` API. In SkyhookDM, since we require to pushdown
compute operations into the Storage backend, we created a new file format on top of Parquet, namely a `RadosParquetFileFormat` which besides providing the benefits of Parquet, allows pushing down filter and projection operations into the storage backend to minimize data moved through the network.

# Getting Started

**NOTE:** Please make sure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is installed.

* Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone --branch v0.1.1 https://github.com/uccross/arrow
```

* Run the `ubuntu-cls-demo` step in the docker-compose file. This step will start a single node Ceph cluster inside the container, mount CephFS, put sample data into CephFS, and open an example Jupyter notebook with PyArrow installed.
```bash
cd arrow/
docker-compose run --service-ports ubuntu-cls-demo
```

# Installation Instructions

* For installing SkyhookDM-Arrow with [Rook](https://rook.io) on Kubernetes, check out [this](https://github.com/uccross/skyhookdm-arrow-docker/blob/master/README.md#deploying-skyhookdm-arrow-on-a-rook-cluster) guide.

* For installing SkyhookDM-Arrow on CloudLab, check out [this](https://github.com/uccross/skyhookdm-workflows/tree/master/cloudlab#deploy-ceph-skyhookdm-on-cloudlab) guide.
 
# Salient Features

* Enables pushing down filters, projections, compute operations to the Storage backend for minimal data transfer over the network.

* Allows storing data in Parquet files for minimizing Disk I/O though predicate and projection pushdown.

* Plugs-in seamlessly into the Arrow Dataset API and leverages all its functionality like dataset discovering,  partition pruning, etc.

* Minimal overhead in requirements: 
    1) Requires CephFS to be mounted. 
    2) Requires using the `SplittedParquetWriter` API to write arrow Tables.

* Built on top of latest Ceph v15.2.x.

# Code Structure

### Client side - C++

* `cpp/src/arrow/dataset/file_rados_parquet.h`: This file contains the definitions of 3 APIs. The `RadosCluster` , `DirectObjectAccess`, and the `RadosParquetFileFormat`. The `RadosCluster` API helps create a connection to the Ceph cluster and provides a handle to the cluster that can be passed around. The `DirectObjectAccess` API provides abstractions for converting filenames in CephFS to object IDs in the Object store and allows interacting with the objects directly. The `RadosParquetFileFormat` API takes in the direct object access construct as input and contains the logic of pushing down scans to the underlying objects that make up a file.

* `cpp/src/arrow/dataset/rados.h`: Contains a wrapper for the `librados` SDK for exposing `librados` methods like `init2`, `connect`, `stat`, `ioctx_create`, and `exec` which are required for establishing the connection to the Ceph cluster and for operating on objects directly. 

* `cpp/src/arrow/dataset/rados_utils.h`: Contains utility functions for (de)serializing query options, query results, etc. Currently, we serialize all the expressions and schemas into a `ceph::bufferlist`, but in a later release, we plan to use a Flatbuffer schema for making the scan options more scalable.

### Client side - Python

* `python/pyarrow/_rados.pyx/_rados.pxd`: Contains Cython bindings to the `RadosParquetFileFormat` C++ API.

* `python/pyarrow/rados.py`: This file contains the definition of the `SplittedParquetWriter`. It is completely implemented in Python.

### Storage side

* `cpp/src/arrow/adapters/arrow-rados-cls/cls_arrow.cc`: Contains the Rados objclass functions and APIs for interacting with objects in the OSDs. Also, it includes a `RandomAccessObject` API to give a random access file view of objects for allowing operations like reading byte ranges, seeks, tell, etc. 

# Setting up the development environment

**NOTE:** Please make sure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is installed.

1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone --branch v0.1.1 https://github.com/uccross/arrow
```

2. Install [Archery](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/archery.html#), the daily development tool by Apache Arrow community.
```bash
cd arrow/
