# SkyhookDM Ceph RADOS Class

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/uccross/skyhookdm-ceph-cls.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/uccross/skyhookdm-ceph-cls)

## What is SkyhookDM?

SkyhookDM extends Ceph distributed object storage with data management functionality for tabular data.  Data is partitioned, and partitions are stored in Ceph objects.  Data management methods are applied directly within the storage system, via the object-level, i.e., 'cls' interface.  Methods include both typical push-downs (offloaded to storage) for query processing such as SELECT, PROJECT, AGGREGATE, and also more general data management techniques such as indexing and physical design, including data layouts and formats.  Data partitions are currently stored as Apache Arrow or Google Flatbuffers format within objects.

## Dev setup

These instructions explain the container-native development setup for 
SkyhookDM. With this approach, there's no need to install build 
dependencies, and instead we download a Docker image containing the 
toolchain that builds, tests and packages the library. For information 
on how to install Docker, take a look at [the official 
documentation][docker-install].

In addition, instead of making use of `docker` commands directly, we 
automate and document these tasks using Popper. You can think of 
Popper as `make` for containers. The Popper tasks defined for this 
project (`dev-init`, `build`, `test`, and `build-rook-img`) are 
defined in the [`.popper.yml`](.popper.yml) file. For information on 
how to install Popper, take a look at [the official 
documentation][popper-install].

Any of the tasks defined in the `.popper.yml` file can be executed in 
interactive mode. For example, to open a shell on the `build` step:

```bash
popper sh build
```

The above opens an interactive shell inside an instance of the 
[builder image](./docker/builder/Dockerfile), which is a pre-built 
image with all the dependencies needed to build the CLS.

### `build`

Build the skyhookdm library:

```bash
popper run build
```

The above builds the code inside the `build/` directory generated by 
CMake.

### interactive `build`

To interactively build the RADOS class, or run tests within this dev 
environment, we can open a shell in this build container for this 
step:

```bash
popper sh build
```

Then, inside the container, we can run tests by doing:

```bash
cd build/

# build
make -j4

# TODO add more example commands on how to test
```
